# SARG04 protocol

SARG04 is yet another modification of [BB84](BB84) in which one additional change is
made in that Alice does not reveal the basis $b$ of her bit, which ensures that
a potential eavesdropper needs to store more copies of the qubit in order to be
able to determine the state, compared to the original protocol.
