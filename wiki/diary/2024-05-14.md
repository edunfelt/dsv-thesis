Added the wiki with diary today, and made sure everything is git-managed to
prevent loss of work and ensure easier collaboration in the future. 

Worked on the introduction section and wrote on the background section here,
introducing QKD and some information on the history of this area. The Wikipedia
articles on the bell state and QKD where quite helpful to find some relevant
resources, as well as the article by Vazirani and Vidick.
