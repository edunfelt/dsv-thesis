Wrote a section on BB84 and also some more exposition about QKD in general,
including the no-cloning theorem and its proof. There is still a need to write
a pseudocode of the BB84 algorithm, thinking I can do this for all algorithms
at once at a later point, and to write a section on privacy amplification and
information reconciliation.
