Wrote a section on BB84 and also some more exposition about QKD in general,
including the no-cloning theorem and its proof. There is still a need to write
a pseudocode of the BB84 algorithm, thinking I can do this for all algorithms
at once at a later point, and to write a section on privacy amplification and
information reconciliation.

Wrote about B92 as well. This can remain in the same section as BB84 for
now, it remains to see if this is appropriate after I have also written about 
SSP, COW, and T12.
