Finally finished a draft of the background section today. This also now opens
up for putting down a proper problem statement and research questions to be
answered. Hoping to finish the remainder of chapter 1 today.

---

Finished the first chapter of the thesis and restructured the background
chapters into two separate ones -- one on QIT and the other on QKD. I still
need to add some context about non-local games to the QIT chapter, and possibly
consider breaking out the main subsection of this chapter to several smaller
sections, however I imagine this is something that will be easier and more
natural to do once I've actually also put some examples of the theory in. 

Goal for the rest of the day now is to write about non-local games and start
working on the chapter about QKD so I have something to go off of the rest of
the week.
