Tonight, I need to finish the methodology chapter of the thesis in order to
have a proper outline of how the work will proceed. Then, tomorrow I will have
some time to work on the background chapters some more and briefly summarize
the different QKD algorithms I will consider. Realistically however, I won't
have time tomorrow to write that part of the thesis as in-depth as I would
like, and I'll have to save it until after the deadline on the 27th. I really
hope it will be fine anyway. 

---

The section on dataset compilation makes no sense for my thesis? I am running
simulations to investigate parameters of QKD algorithms, not performing
interviews or distributing questionnaires? What is there even to say here?
Will continue the rest of this chapter tomorrow morning.
