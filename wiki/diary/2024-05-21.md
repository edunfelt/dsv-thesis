Looked into the literature on QKD more thoroughly today. Came to the conclusion
that basically all entanglement-based protocols are built on the same principle
-- using the CHSH game as a foundation for testing entanglement and then
generating keys from rounds that are not used to verify entanglement since the
qubits are pretty much guaranteed to be perfectly correlated.

There are also a number of protocols that are not based on entanglement of
which there are still some being developed quite recently. Likely, some of
these can also be converted to entanglement-based protocols as proposed by
Bennet & Brassard in 1992. This is one aspect I can look into further.

Also, device-independence is a quite recent development in the field and might
also just require a slight modification of existing protocols in order to have
the security rely on observed behavior rather than specifications of the
involved devices. This is something I can look into secondarily.

Finally, I've thus come to the conclusion that I'm looking to implement and
compare the most significant protocols in QKD, starting with BB84, investigate
their properties with regards to security, device-independence, and which
property of quantum mechanics that is used to ensure security and generate
keys. Furthermore, if time allows I will also look into and simulate the following:

- attacks on protocols
- converting to entanglement-based key generation
- implementing tests to achieve device-independence
