# E91 protocol

The first entanglement-based protocol. The steps proceed as follows:

1. Alice and Bob both obtain maximally entangled qubits, presumably Bell states
   from an external source.
2. Alice generates measurement bases for each qubit, represented by an $n$-bit
   string. She measures the qubits sequentially in each of the bases and sends
   the measurement outcomes along with the chosen bases to Bob.
3. Bob generates measurement bases, represented by a string in $\{0, 1, 2\}^n$.
   He measures the qubits sequentially in these bases and sends the measurement
   outcomes along with the bases to Alice.
4. Alice choose a random subset of indices of size $n / 2$ and sends to Bob.
5. Alice and Bob compare their results with the Bell test statistic in order to
   determine whether the measured qubits have indeed been entangled or not. If
   so is the case, the qubits on which they used the same measurement basis can
   be used to generate a shared secret key.
