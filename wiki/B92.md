# B92 protocol

The B92 protocol is a modification of [BB84](BB84.md) in which only one, non-orthogonal,
basis is used instead of two orthogonal bases.

1. Alice choose a random bit string of length $n$ and encodes it by sending to
   Bob a tensor product of quantum states, either the 0-state for bit 0 or the
   first Hadamard state for bit 1.
2. Bob measures the qubits either in the standard or the Hadamard basis. If he
   measures in the standard basis and observes a 0, the result is 0. Likewise,
   if he measures in the Hadamard basis and observes the +-state, the result is
   1.
3. Bob announces to Alice the cases in which he observed a 1 or the $-$-state,
   while measuring in the standard or the Hadamard basis, respectively. These
   bits can be eliminated. Bob also shares half of the bits where a 0 or a
   +-state were observed and they compare results.
4. Alice and Bob can use the remaining bits as a shared secret key.
