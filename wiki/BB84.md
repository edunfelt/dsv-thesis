# BB84 protocol

See also [B92](B92.md).

1. Alice creates two $n$-bit strings $a$ and $b$. She encodes the information
   as an tensor product of $n$ qubits where each individual qubit corresponds
   to one bit of $a$ and $b$ such that $b_i$ determines the encoding basis of
   $a_i$. Four mutually orthogonal basis states are used -- the Hadamard basis
   and the standard basis. The state is transmitted to Bob.
2. Bob randomly generates a bit string $b'$ of length $n$ deciding in which
   basis to measure the qubits of the quantum state. Measurement yields a bit
   string $a'$. Bob announces that he is ready.
3. Alice publicly announces $b$.
4. Bob compare $b$ with $b'$ and announces which indices are equal. Alice and
   Bob both keep these bits of $a$ and $a'$, respectively, and discard the
   others thereby creating a bit string $c$.
5. Alice randomly chooses a subset $I$ of indices of $c$, of size $k / 2$ and 
   sends these to Bob.
6. Alice and Bob compare whether their bits on these indices agree above a
   predetermined threshold. If they do, the remaining bits can be used as
   a shared secret key.
