### Research Question {#ssec:researchq}

To approach the problem stated in the preceding section, we here specify the
research questions to be answered in this thesis. The following research questions
are identified:

- Which prominent directions and techniques exists in QKD?
- How does simulations of prominent QKD protocols compare in terms of size of
  the keys generated and error in key generation?
- How can QKD protocols be extended to be diQKD and what is the impact on their
  efficiency in this case?
- What are the practical and theoretical benefit and drawbacks of using
  entanglement for key generation over relying on the Heisenberg uncertainty
  principle?

The research questions will be addressed by performing simulations in Qiskit as
well as through theoretical analysis of the different protocols. Although
potentially of great significance, the thesis will not investigate and compare
the physical implementation of QKD protocols and the impact of such techniques.
