### Data Analysis {#ssec:analysis}

The simulations generate primary quantitative data which is analyzed by
following the quantitative data analysis steps provided in Chapter 3 of
@DenscombeGoodResearch2010. Since we are investigating the size of keys
generated by different QKD protocols and the error observed as per the research
questions, as well as the impact on these parameters that modifications of the
protocols result in, we will produce numerical data that is presented in plots
and tables. In our analysis, the crucial parameter is the number of qubits used
in the simulation, as it is expected that this is the main driving factor
impacting the size of keys and the error in each protocol, and this will be
plotted against the variables of interest for each simulation. After possible
modification has been made to the protocols, further experiments will be
conducted in a similar manner.

To eliminate the possibility of bias in the data analysis, we ensure that each
protocol is tested against consistent metrics, using the same parameters for
comparison. Furthermore, all protocols are implemented and executed in the same
computational environment to ensure repeatability of results and that no bias
is introduced in the data.
