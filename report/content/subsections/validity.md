### Validity and Reliability {#ssec:validity}

We will ensure reliability of the quantitative data and subsequent analysis and
results by ensuring that the processing of collecting and analyzing the data is
consistent and repeatable. For this reason, we will produce the source code of
the simulations online @EdunfeltDsvthesis in a GitHub repository. This allows
other researchers to both examine the code itself, repeat experiments, and
scrutinize the stages in which the results were produced due to the nature of
version control systems such as Git. 

Furthermore, to ensure validity, the results obtained during the simulation
stage for each protocol will be compared with the reported accuracy and key
length as the number of qubits used increases in the original articles
introducing the protocols. This is done to ensure that there are no errors in
the code that could cause greatly deviating results from the expected.
