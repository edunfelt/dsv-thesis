### Alternative Research Strategies {#ssec:altstrat}

In this section we consider alternative research strategies that could have
been used in the project, in favor of the experimental approach. One possible
alternative strategy as discussed in @DenscombeGoodResearch2010 is to use the
action research strategy. The goal of action research is to solve a practical
problem or to produce guidelines for a best practice within an area.

Typically, action research focuses on improving work in some practice, in this
case the practice of QKD, and works in a cyclical process to identify possible
aspects of improvement, implement changes, and take in feedback from
practitioners. To address the research topic at hand, a possible alternative
approach to the project using action research could thus be to focus on the
practical problem of QKD, and gather qualitative data from practitioners in the
field detailing the primary problems and challenges faced today, and then
perform a theoretical investigating of how existing protocols could be improved
to address these challenges. Then, through simulations and further
consultations with practitioners in an iterative process we could seek to
improve existing QKD protocols. With the strategy selected in Section
@ssec:strategy instead we focus on obtaining a controlled comparison of
existing solutions, and then perform a theoretical analysis to investigate
possible improvements that could be made, both for the purpose of possibly
improving the practice of QKD, but also for purposes of further research.
