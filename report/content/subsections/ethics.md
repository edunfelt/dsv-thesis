### Ethical Considerations {#ssec:ethics}

Since the research in this work does not rely on studying participants or
practitioners there are no ethical considerations to make with regards to the
subjects of studying. However, as with all research, there are of naturally
ethical concerns to consider with regards to the impact of the research as well
as the nature in which it is conducted. The research is conducted with honesty
and integrity which is partly ensured through the presentation of the result
and research process, in each step clearly specifying the goals of the data
collection, analysis, and presentation. Furthermore, the research is conducted
in line with the law and does not concern itself with sensitive subject matters
or intellectual property rights. Wherever applicable, proper referencing is
made to ensure that it is clear where original ideas originate. The result of
the research is presented in an unbiased and neutral way, ensuring that there
are no misinterpretations of results.

Finally, the impact of the work is considered with regards to society. Quantum
cryptography as a field has the potential to have great impact on society, both
negative and positive. In particular, advances in quantum computing have the
potential to break traditional cryptosystems that much of the worlds security
builds upon @NielsenChuangQuantumComputation2010. Development of techniques in
QKD on the other hand has less clear negative impacts, as its primary focus is
to enhance security by providing new and secure methods for key distribution to
further enhance already existing systems.
