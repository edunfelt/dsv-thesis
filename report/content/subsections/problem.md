### Problem {#ssec:problem}

This text is concerned with the simulation of existing QKD protocols based on
different aspects of quantum mechanics as well as a theoretical investigation
of relevant protocols within the area. Simulation is done using the OpenQASM
software development kit, Qiskit. Current research largely strive to implement
protocols in physical hardware, however there is still a need to run
large-scale simulations to obtain a larger picture of the current landscape and
compare the different approaches to QKD in order to understand possibilities for
improvement and development of new techniques within the field. Parameters of
interest for simulation include the size of the keys generated, the size of the
error in the protocol, and number of qubits utilized. Theoretical investigation
allows us to further examine the actual properties of the protocols compared
such as the specifics of the techniques utilized and security assumptions.
Furthermore, the question of whether specific QKD protocols can be modified to
allow for device-independentness can be investigated, as well as the
possibility of converting uncertainty-based protocols to entanglement-based
techniques.

Thus, the thesis tackles the problem of simulating and comparing prominent
existing QKD protocols that are of significance in current research, as well as
providing a theoretical examination of the protocols with the goal of comparing
their general properties and possibilities for extending the same.
