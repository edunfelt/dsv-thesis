### Overview {#ssec:overview-qit}

In the following chapter, we aim to introduce to the unfamiliar reader the
fundamentals of quantum information theory and of key distribution schemes in
the area of quantum cryptography. The perspective here taken loosely follows
the presentation given in @NielsenChuangQuantumComputation2010, although
it presents the material from a fairly mathematically heavy perspective. The
reader is expected to be familiar with linear algebra, the fundamentals of
operator algebras, basic number theory, as well as elementary notions in
theoretical computer science. For a complete reference on these topics
necessary to understand the following material, the reader is advised to
consult @NielsenChuangQuantumComputation2010.

In Section @ssec:qit we cover the basic notions of quantum information theory
from the perspective of theoretical computer science, presenting the
mathematical model upon which it is based, elementary gates and operations, as
well as measurements and entangled qubits. Section @ssec:games introduces the
concept of entanglement and quantum non-local games which is used in our later
endeavors both to generate keys as well as to verify the existence of
entanglement. These are the main building blocks of the thesis and are
necessary to both understand the historical as well as the theoretical
background on which protocols in QKD are built. Finally, Section @ssec:qkd
covers the primary protocols and techniques that exist in the field of QKD,
which will be further examined and simulated in Chapter @sec:mainres.
